  Compatibility with 
CMake < 3.5 has been 
removed from CMake.

  Update the VERSION 
argument <min> value. 
 Or, use the 
<min>...<max> syntax
  to tell CMake that 
the project requires 
at least <min> but 
has been updated
  to work with 
policies introduced 
by <max> or earlier.

  Or, add -DCMAKE_POLI
CY_VERSION_MINIMUM=3.5
 to try configuring 
anyway.
